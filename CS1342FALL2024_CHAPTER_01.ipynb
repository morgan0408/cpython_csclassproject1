        "**1. Indentation:**\n",
        "- **What is Indentation?**\n",
        "  - In Python, indentation is used to define the structure and scope of code blocks, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.\n",
        "- **Importance:**\n",
        "  - Unlike other languages that use braces `{}`, Python relies on indentation to indicate which statements belong to a particular block of code.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  if True:\n",
        "      print(\"This is inside the if block\")\n",
        "  print(\"This is outside the if block\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - In this example, the `print(\"This is inside the if block\")` is indented, meaning it belongs to the `if` block, whereas `print(\"This is outside the if block\")` is not indented, so it’s outside the block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Balanced Parentheses and Brackets:**\n",
        "- **Use Cases:**\n",
        "  - **Parentheses `()`**: Used for grouping expressions, calling functions, and defining tuples.\n",
        "  - **Square Brackets `[]`**: Used for list indexing, slicing, and defining lists.\n",
        "  - **Curly Braces `{}`**: Used for defining dictionaries and sets.\n",
        "- **Balancing:**\n",
        "  - All opening parentheses, brackets, and braces must have corresponding closing counterparts.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  list_example = [1, 2, 3, (4, 5), {\"key\": \"value\"}]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - This example includes balanced parentheses for the tuple `(4, 5)`, square brackets for the list `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, and curly braces for the dictionary `{\"key\": \"value\"}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Balanced Quotation Marks:**\n",
        "- **Single `'` and Double `\"` Quotation Marks:**\n",
        "  - Used to define string literals in Python. You can use either single or double quotes, but they must match.\n",
        "- **Multiline Strings:**\n",
        "  - Triple quotes `'''` or `\"\"\"` are used for multiline strings or docstrings (documentation within the code).\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  single_quote = 'Hello, World!'\n",
        "  double_quote = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "  multiline_string = \"\"\"This is a\n",
        "  multiline string.\"\"\"\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - The example shows a string defined using single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes for a multiline string.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Comments:**\n",
        "- **Single-Line Comments:**\n",
        "  - Use the `#` symbol to write comments. Anything after `#` on the same line is ignored by the interpreter.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # This is a comment\n",
        "  print(\"This line will be executed\")  # This is an inline comment\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **Multiline Comments:**\n",
        "  - Though Python doesn't have a specific syntax for multiline comments, you can use triple quotes to write a block of comments.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  \"\"\"\n",
        "  This is a\n",
        "  multiline comment.\n",
        "  \"\"\"\n",
        "  print(\"This line will be executed\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Case Sensitivity:**\n",
        "- **Python is Case-Sensitive:**\n",
        "  - Variable names, function names, and other identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, `myVar`, `Myvar`, and `MYVAR` would be considered different variables.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  myVar = 10\n",
        "  print(myvar)  # This will cause an error because myvar is not the same as myVar\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Statements and Line Continuation:**\n",
        "- **Single-Line Statements:**\n",
        "  - Python usually assumes each line is a separate statement.\n",
        "- **Line Continuation:**\n",
        "  - Use a backslash `\\` to continue a statement across multiple lines.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  result = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\\n",
        "           4 + 5 + 6\n",
        "  print(result)  # Output will be 21\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "These key points cover the essentials of Python's basic syntax, including indentation, balancing parentheses and quotation marks, comments, case sensitivity, and handling statements across multiple lines. Understanding and following these rules is crucial for writing error-free and readable Python code."
